# React Notes

## What is React?
Link to [React Website](https://opensource.fb.com/projects/react/)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. If you don't know what JavaScript is , you can learn more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript). The full depth of JavaScript is significant and won't be covered here. 

From Wikipedia:
> A library is a collection of resources that is leveraged during software development to implement a computer program. Commonly, a library consists of executable code such as compiled functions and classes, or a library can be a collection of source code. A resource library may contain data

In plain English: A bunch of code, functions or classed that is often shared 
 

## Why learn it?
1) It's the most widely used front end framework used by web developers. 
2) It will likely be relevant for many more years as it is maintaned by Meta/Facebook. 
3) It will teach you important transferrable programming concepts that are more easily transferrable.
4) Learning new things is exciting!

## Should you learn JavaScript before learning React?
Yes, but don't spend too much time on it if you already know another programming language because there's likely to be considerable overlap of many concepts you are familiar with, as well as syntax.

## How to create a React App?

It's easy to get started using [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
```bash
# npm 6.x (outdated, but still used by some):
npm create vite@latest introdemo --template react

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest introdemo -- --template react

```
