# React Notes

## What is React?

React is a front end framework for web development. It allows you to create component-based user interfaces using JavaScript/JSX. It's the most widely used front end framework used by web developers in 2025.

## How to create a React App?

It's easy to get started using [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
```bash
# npm 6.x (outdated, but still used by some):
npm create vite@latest introdemo --template react

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest introdemo -- --template react

```
