# Python Notes

Python is cool. It's a an easy programming language to get started with if you don't know anything about programming. In my experience, it's most fun to dive right in and start coding, rather than reading tutorials and documentation. Let's get started.

Here's how you can print things:

```python
title = "Python Notes"
print(title) # Prints "Python Notes" in the terminal
```

You can also use f strings to then print variables:

```python

title = "Python Notes"
print(f"Welcome to {title}") # Prints 'Welcome to Python Notes'

```

You can also create lists, which are containers for other things like variables and strings:

```python
a_list = [] # Creates an empty list
```

Adding things to a list is easy:

```python
a_list = []
a_list.append("thing") # Append means add to the END
print(a_list) 

```
```python

```
```python

```
```python

```
```python

```
```python

```
```python

```
```python

```
```python

```
